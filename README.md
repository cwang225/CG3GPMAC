## Game Summary

The main premise of our game will be a tactics based game where the main character starts out as a low level soldier in a dark cult on a planet. There are 6 planets in total which made up a planetary alliance, but the planet the main character is on has defected from the planet alliance, and the cult works against the other 5 planets. He messes up on a mission and is given an “impossible” mission by the head commander as a punishment: collecting/capturing the five Manite crystals from the other planets and taking them back home so that his planet can summon their deity. 

Against all odds, MC is able to bring back the first crystal, so the head commander decides to keep sending MC to get all the crystals. Along this journey, MC will make and meet new companions that help him fight. He works his way up in the ranks and slowly becomes a highly celebrated soldier. He continues to succeed and returns the crystals to the cult, but he begins to have doubts about the cult and their goals.  

## Genres

Our game will be a turn-based strategy/tactical RPG game. 

## Inspiration

### Gameplay: Fire Emblem Series

https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fire-emblem-three-houses-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOopnIw-sq7DpgL-30SHmb01lnq_-IGDxUPdQOQKrwuV8m9Q-I_Z1 
Fire Emblem is a series of turn-based tactical RPG games and will be the main inspiration for our game mechanics. In Fire Emblem, the game is typically split between a hub, where the player interacts with NPCs and progresses the story, and battles. The battles are turn-based, where the player and the enemy AI take turns moving and attacking with each of their units. It’s top-down and uses a square grid of tiles. The map includes terrain features that help or hinder the player, as well as pathways between different elevations. Our game will use this tactics gameplay as a base, with some differences like less actions for the units to take (i.e. no items), and all combat will be shown in the overworld rather than go into a separate battle scene.

### Gameplay: Undaunted 2200: Callisto

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/401978/undaunted-2200-callisto 
Undaunted 2200: Callisto is a tactical war board game set on a sci-fi mining colony. The two main ways it will influence our design is through its territory control and use of elevation and terrain. Controlling territory is one of the most important aspects of the game, and it’s done well in relatively small, claustrophobic maps. These maps utilize different features like bridges, towers, and three levels of elevation which can give ranged units huge advantages to attacking. We want our game to also involve territory control, through sigils and other terrain features, and to utilize elevation in a similar way. Also, because our game will take place underground on alien planets and the enemies will be sci-fi soldiers, the claustrophobic maps and art/vibes can also be an inspiration.

It will also take inspiration from chess in that positional advantage matters a lot as does careful board control.

### Visual Art: Peak

We will be referencing Peak when designing our main character and player bodies / overall model shape + movement

### Sound: Omori

We will be referencing Omori for sound. Thinking of simpler background music that still fits the vibe.

### Vibes: Cult of the Lamb

We are taking vibe inspirations from Cult of the Lamb because we want to capture the occult vibe and the mix of cute characters/graphics with dark story and themes. 
(we also might do 2d characters in a 3d world?)

## Gameplay
The player will control a cultist who is trying to collect n (5, 7?) magic crystals stored on neighboring planets. They must control a small team of followers and successfully kill/knock out interplanetary alliance forces (?) on n levels by seizing territory strategically using a range of abilities (e.g. sigils placed on the ground which can be activated and have AoE effects.) Other tools include melee and intra-team healing. There will be mana springs across the map which give the holder increased mana regeneration, adding to the territory-control aspect of the game. Mana from springs is distributed across player characters evenly, but mana is not pooled. There will be elevation differences on the map which can be exploited for strategic purposes. Levels are accessible from a hub world, which contains portals to each level. Once all five hub world levels are complete (in a ring around a center) the player is able to summon their god, which turns on them and brings the MC and their companions to a final level. Each member of the player’s team (including the MC) has a unique class giving unique abilities to each member.

Expected user interface and game-controls: the game can be played using either a controller or keyboard. Between battles, they can move around (WASD, joystick) in the hub world to speak to NPC companions. During the battle, the player can switch selection between units, look around the map, and direct units to take actions. The UI will show whose turn it is (player/enemy), unit stats, relevant terrain effects (when hovering/selecting a tile), and when selecting a unit, the list of available actions. There can also be toggleable UI to overlay the tile grid (see Fire Emblem screenshot) with extra information like the range of each enemy.


## Development Plan

By Oct 1st (Checkpoint 1-2):  
Megan:  
* Tile-based map with elevations
* Units with stats
* Unit movement
* Unit selection/control
* Turn system
* Enemy AI  
Carly:  
* In-battle UI
* Dialogue system (out of battle)
* Hub world movement
* Level selection  
Alex:  
* Combat between units
* Sigils (AoE)
* Camera Control  


Nice to have Mechanics:
* In-battle dialogue
* Cut scenes (for final boss)
* Mana pools
